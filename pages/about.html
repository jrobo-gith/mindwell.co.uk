        <p class="qualified-text">I am qualified person-centred counsellor based in Warwickshire but able to work online anywhere in the UK. Person-Centred counselling provides a supportive and non-judgemental space for you to talk openly about anything and everything that might be troubling you at that moment in time. My role is to support you in finding answers to the things that are troubling you and to guide you in building resilience so you can deal with whatever comes your way in the future.</p>

        <div class="training-text">
            <p>My personal experiences and training have given me a broad understanding of life and emotions which has led me to a non-judgmental down-to-earth approach. My areas of professional expertise include depression, anxiety, stress, relationships, self-esteem, parent and child relationships, self harming, loss and trauma. I believe in personal growth and I want to empower my clients to gain knowledge, self awareness and self-confidence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="experience-text">
            <p>I gained experience in an agency that was passionate about removing shame from the therapy process and enabling people to feel confident in asking for help when it is needed but also building resilience to help themselves build strategies for the future.Â </p>

        <div class="young-people-text">
            <p>I have also worked with young people in a pastoral role for many years so I can see the challenges of being a teenager in a world that feels as though it is shifting underneath you.<br>My clients are of all genders presenting with an array of different diagnoses and life issues including those who want to maintain a sense of wellbeing.</p>
