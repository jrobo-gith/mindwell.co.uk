ISSUES
1. Incorporate universal classes to make things like bulky text font size, color, etc consistent
2. Images loading slower than browser loading
3. Sizing will be screwed up if I change to other device rn.
4. When I click the other part of the screen when the navbar is showing, i want the navbar to disappear.
